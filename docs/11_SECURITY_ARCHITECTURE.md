## 1. Purpose

QST has an unusual dual security surface: it is software that **simulates** a security protocol. This document separates two distinct concerns that must not be conflated:

1. **The security properties of BB84 itself**, which the simulation must model correctly.
2. **The security of the QST codebase itself**, as a piece of software (dependency risk, code execution risk, etc.).

## 2. Two Distinct Security Contexts

    B --> B1[No-cloning theorem]

    C --> C3[No execution of untrusted code]
```

## 3. Threat Model: BB84 Protocol Being Simulated

| Actor | Capability Modeled | Currently Simulated? |
|---|---|---|
| Eve (passive eavesdropper) | Intercepts qubits, measures, resends | Planned (FR-5) |
| Eve (active/other attacks — e.g., PNS on real hardware) | Beyond intercept-resend | Future — out of scope for v1.0 |
| Malicious classical channel actor | Tampering with sifting/reconciliation messages | Future — not modeled; BB84's classical channel is assumed authenticated per standard protocol assumptions |

## 4. BB84 Security Properties (What the Simulation Must Correctly Demonstrate)

- **No-cloning theorem:** Eve cannot perfectly copy an unknown quantum state, so any interception introduces detectable disturbance. The simulation's intercept-resend model (FR-5) must reflect this by introducing measurable QBER increase, not a "free" copy.
- **Measurement disturbance:** Measuring a qubit in the wrong basis disturbs its state with 50% probability, which is the mathematical source of the ~25% expected QBER under full interception (see `05_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` acceptance criteria).
- **Eavesdropper detectability via QBER:** The core pedagogical claim of the toolkit is that eavesdropping is statistically detectable. Test cases in `14_TESTING_STRATEGY.md` must verify this holds across the implementation, not just in theory.

> **Critical implementation note:** Any future contributor modifying the Eavesdropper model (`EVE` in `07_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`) must re-verify these acceptance criteria — an implementation bug that makes eavesdropping *not* raise QBER would silently invalidate the entire pedagogical point of the toolkit.

## 5. Threat Model: The Software Itself

| Threat | Relevance to QST | Mitigation (Planned) |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency supply-chain compromise (e.g., compromised PyPI package) | Real — QST depends on Qiskit and its transitive dependencies | Pin dependency versions; monitor advisories (see `17_RISK_REGISTER.md`, §10 below) |
| Unsafe deserialization of exported/imported result files | Possible if JSON/CSV import is added carelessly | Use safe parsers only (e.g., `json.loads`, never `eval`/`pickle` on untrusted input) |
| Arbitrary code execution via CLI parameter injection | Low risk (parameters are numeric) but must be validated | Strict type/range validation on all CLI/API inputs |
| Malicious contributions (PRs) | Low risk at current single-maintainer stage | Code review before merge (see `16_CODING_STANDARDS.md`) |

## 6. STRIDE Analysis

> Applied to QST-as-software (not to the simulated BB84 protocol, which has its own model in §3–4).

| STRIDE Category | Applicable Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **S**poofing | Not applicable — no authentication surface exists (local library/CLI, no user accounts) | N/A for v1.0 |
| **T**ampering | A malicious or compromised dependency altering simulation output | Dependency pinning, SBOM (§10), `pip-audit` in CI |
| **R**epudiation | Not applicable — no multi-user audit trail requirement for a local educational tool | N/A for v1.0 |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Exported CSV/JSON files could inadvertently include more than intended (e.g., full sifted key exposed in a shared research dataset) | Document clearly in export function docstrings and `10_API_SPECIFICATION.md` that exported keys are simulation artifacts, not secrets to be protected — but avoid unnecessary verbosity in default export fields |
| **D**enial of Service | Extremely large `n_qubits` causing memory exhaustion (see `05_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` EC-6) | Input validation with sane upper bounds; graceful `ValidationError` rather than an unhandled crash |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Not applicable — QST requires no elevated OS privileges to run | N/A for v1.0 |

## 7. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

> QST is an educational/research simulator, not a network-facing production system, so most enterprise ATT&CK techniques (lateral movement, credential access, etc.) are **not applicable**. The mapping below is scoped to the techniques genuinely relevant to a locally-run Python package with dependency risk.

| ATT&CK Technique (ID) | Relevance to QST |
|---|---|
| T1195 — Supply Chain Compromise | Relevant — mitigated via dependency pinning and SBOM/vulnerability scanning (§10) |
| T1059 — Command and Scripting Interpreter | Relevant only in the sense that QST *is* a Python script users run; no attacker-controlled scripting surface exists within QST itself |
| T1499 — Endpoint Denial of Service | Relevant at small scale — see STRIDE "Denial of Service" row above (resource exhaustion via oversized `n_qubits`) |
| Most other enterprise techniques (lateral movement, C2, exfiltration, credential access) | **Not applicable** — QST has no network component, no credentials, and no multi-host footprint in its current or near-term architecture |

This mapping should be revisited if any Future networked feature (web dashboard, AI Tutor API calls) is added, since those would introduce a meaningfully different attack surface.

## 8. Secure Coding Principles for QST

- Never use `eval`, `exec`, or `pickle.load` on any user- or file-supplied data.
- Validate all numeric inputs (qubit count, probabilities, seeds) at API boundaries before passing into simulation logic.
- Pin and periodically audit dependencies (Qiskit and transitive deps) for known CVEs.
- Keep the simulation core free of any network calls, so running QST locally carries no data-exfiltration risk by design.

## 9. Secure SDLC

**Planned** lifecycle integration (no SDLC has been executed yet — pre-development):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Design[Design: threat model reviewed per feature] --> Implement[Implement: secure coding principles - §8]
    Implement --> Test[Test: security regression tests - 14_TESTING_STRATEGY.md §4]
    Test --> CIScan[CI: dependency + SBOM scan - §10]
    CIScan --> Review[Peer/self review vs. 16_CODING_STANDARDS.md checklist]
    Review --> Release[Release: SBOM published alongside artifact]
    Release --> Monitor[Monitor: advisory watch for dependencies]
    Monitor --> Design
```

Every feature touching `core/` (BB84Protocol, Eavesdropper) or `analytics/` must be checked against §4's acceptance criteria before merge, per `00_PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` §8 Definition of Done.

## 10. Supply Chain Security & SBOM Strategy

**Planned:**

- A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), in CycloneDX or SPDX format, will be generated at build/release time (e.g., via `cyclonedx-py` or equivalent tooling) once CI/CD exists (`13_DEPLOYMENT.md`).
- `pip-audit` (or equivalent) runs in CI on every PR and on a scheduled basis against `main`, to catch newly disclosed CVEs in already-released QST versions.
- Dependency versions are pinned (not just floor-bounded) in released artifacts to ensure reproducible, auditable builds (see `06_TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` §8 Version Support Policy).
- The SBOM is published alongside each PyPI release as a release asset, so downstream users (e.g., a university IT department vetting the toolkit) can audit QST's dependency tree without installing it first.

## 11. Responsible Disclosure Workflow

**Planned** (no vulnerabilities have been reported — no code exists yet):

1. A `SECURITY.md` file will be added at repository root once the repo is scaffolded, specifying a private contact channel (e.g., a dedicated email or GitHub Security Advisory) for reporting suspected vulnerabilities.
2. Reports are acknowledged within a stated target window (exact SLA **To Be Implemented** — reasonable for a solo-maintainer project, e.g., best-effort within 7 days).
3. Confirmed vulnerabilities are fixed and disclosed via a GitHub Security Advisory with credit to the reporter (unless they request anonymity), following coordinated disclosure norms.
4. Given QST's nature (no user data, no network service — see §6 STRIDE), realistic vulnerability classes are expected to be dependency-related (§10) or resource-exhaustion (§6 DoS row) rather than data breaches.

## 12. Cryptographic Design Notes

QST simulates BB84's **key agreement** step only. It intentionally does **not** implement:

- Privacy amplification (Future — would be needed for a "real" deployable QKD key, out of scope for the educational-simulation goal of v1.0).
- Authentication of the classical channel (assumed/abstracted away, as is standard in introductory BB84 treatments).

This is a deliberate scoping decision, not an oversight: the goal is teaching the core quantum mechanism, not producing a production-grade QKD stack. This must be stated clearly in user-facing documentation so learners don't mistake QST for a deployable security product.

## 13. Future Hardening

- Add privacy amplification simulation for a more complete protocol picture (Future).
- Add authenticated classical channel simulation, showing what happens if that assumption is violated (Future).
- Formal dependency-scanning CI step (e.g., `pip-audit`) once CI exists (Planned, tied to `13_DEPLOYMENT.md` — also see §10).
- Revisit STRIDE/ATT&CK mappings (§6, §7) if any networked feature is added.

## 14. Assumptions

- QST is explicitly an educational/research simulator, not a production key-distribution system — this framing bounds the entire threat model.
- The responsible disclosure SLA (§11) is a placeholder reflecting solo-maintainer capacity and should be revisited if the contributor base grows.

## 15. Scope

Covers both the simulated protocol's security properties and the codebase's own security posture. Does not cover deployment-environment hardening beyond what's noted in `13_DEPLOYMENT.md`.
