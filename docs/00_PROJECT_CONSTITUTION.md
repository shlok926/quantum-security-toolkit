## 1. Purpose

This document is the constitutional root of the Quantum Security Toolkit (QST). Every other document in `docs/` derives its authority from the principles set out here. Where any other document conflicts with this one, this document wins until amended.

QST does not yet have an implementation. This constitution exists first, deliberately, so that the first line of code written is already accountable to a stated vision, a stated set of engineering standards, and a stated definition of "done."

## 2. Vision

To become the most comprehensive open-source educational and research toolkit for quantum-secure communication — covering BB84 protocol simulation, quantum cryptography visualization, attack simulation, and quantum security education — serving students, researchers, security engineers, quantum developers, universities, and industry professionals.

## 3. Mission

- Provide a correct, well-tested, pedagogically clear simulation of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution protocol using Qiskit.
- Make quantum cryptography concepts visually and interactively understandable, not just mathematically correct.
- Model realistic attack scenarios (e.g., intercept-resend eavesdropping) so learners can see *why* QKD is secure, not just be told it is.
- Provide security analytics on simulation runs (QBER, key rate, eavesdropper detection probability) with rigor suitable for research use.
- Maintain a codebase that a new contributor can read, understand, and extend without private context.

## 4. Core Principles

| # | Principle | Meaning |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Correctness over cleverness | Quantum protocol logic must be provably correct before it is fast or elegant. |
| 2 | No fabricated claims | Documentation and marketing describe only what exists or is explicitly marked "Planned"/"Future." |
| 3 | Education first | Every feature should make quantum security *more* understandable, not less. |
| 4 | Reproducibility | Every simulation result must be reproducible from a fixed seed and documented parameters. |
| 5 | Open by default | Code, docs, and design decisions are public unless there is a specific security reason otherwise. |
| 6 | Security is a first-class feature | The toolkit that teaches security must itself follow secure coding practice. |

## 5. Engineering Standards

- **Language:** Python 3.11+ (see `06_TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`).
- **Quantum framework:** Qiskit (version pinned per release; see Technical Requirements).
- **Style:** PEP 8, enforced via `black` + `ruff` (Planned — not yet configured, no repo exists).
- **Testing:** `pytest`, minimum coverage targets defined in `14_TESTING_STRATEGY.md` (Planned).
- **Type hints:** Required on all public functions once implementation begins (Planned).
- **Dependency hygiene:** Pinned versions in `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` (Planned).

> **Current Status:** None of the above is implemented yet — this is a specification for the first commit, not a description of an existing codebase.

## 6. Documentation Standards

Every document in `docs/` must contain:

- Table of Contents
- Version information
- Author section
- Last updated date
- Assumptions
- Scope
- References (cross-links to other `docs/` files)
- Glossary (where domain terms are introduced)
- Mermaid diagrams wherever a diagram clarifies structure or flow
- An explicit **Implementation Status** section distinguishing **Current**, **Planned**, and **Future**
- A **Future Improvements** section

No document may present a planned or future feature as if it currently exists.

## 7. Development Workflow

**Planned** (no repository exists yet, so no workflow has been executed):

1. Repository initialized from this documentation set.
2. Core BB84 simulation engine built first (see `15_ROADMAP.md`, Phase 1).
3. Feature branches off `main`, conventional commits (see `16_CODING_STANDARDS.md`).
4. PRs require passing tests + doc updates before merge.
5. Releases tagged per `19_RELEASE_PLAN.md`.

## 8. Definition of Done

A feature is "Done" only when:

1. Code is merged to `main` with tests passing.
2. Public functions have type hints and docstrings.
3. Relevant `docs/` files are updated (no stale documentation).
4. Test coverage meets the threshold in `14_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`.
5. Security-relevant code has been checked against `11_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
6. A CHANGELOG entry exists (Planned mechanism — no CHANGELOG exists yet).

## 9. Project Governance

- **Current stage:** Single maintainer (ParaDise) — solo-builder governance.
- **Decision authority:** Project owner, recorded in `18_DECISION_LOG.md`.
- **Planned (Future):** Contributor guidelines, CODEOWNERS, and a lightweight RFC process once the project accepts external contributions.

## 10. Assumptions

- The project will be developed primarily by a single engineer initially, with the codebase structured for future open-source contribution.
- Python + Qiskit is the fixed technology baseline unless a documented architectural decision changes it (`18_DECISION_LOG.md`).
- The project targets public/open-source distribution (e.g., GitHub) rather than a closed commercial product.

## 11. Scope

This document governs project-wide values and standards. It does not govern specific technical implementation (see `06_TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `07_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`) or specific feature requirements (see `05_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`).

## 13. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| BB84 | The first quantum key distribution protocol, proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984. |
| QKD | Quantum Key Distribution — using quantum mechanics to securely distribute a cryptographic key. |
| QBER | Quantum Bit Error Rate — the fraction of key bits that differ between sender and receiver, used to detect eavesdropping. |
| Qiskit | IBM's open-source Python SDK for programming quantum computers and simulators. |

## Implementation Status

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| This constitution | **Current** — adopted as of this document's version |
| Enforcement tooling (CI, linters) | **Planned** |
| Contributor governance process | **Future** |

## Future Improvements

- Formalize a CONTRIBUTING.md once external contributors are expected.
- Add a governance charter if the project grows beyond a single maintainer.
